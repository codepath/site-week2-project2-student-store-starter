        The codepath student store offers great products at great prices from a great team and for a great cause.
        <br/> <br />
        We've searched far and wide for items that perk the interests of even the most eccentric students and decided to offer them all here in one place.
        <br/> <br />

        All proceeds go towards bringing high quality CS education to college students around the country.
