# Student Store Project

Selling merchandise in the modern era requires digital solutions. For this project, you'll be tasked with designing and constructing an online student store for the College of CodePath. The web app consists of a frontend user interface for potential customers to browse available goods and a backend API to handle data management. The API will be built with Node and Express, and the UI will be built with React.

Check out our [deployed Student Store](https://codepath-student-store-demo.surge.sh/) for reference! Explore the exemplar by trying the following tasks:

- Click on the different categories (clothing, food, etc.) to filter the list of products.
- Search for an existing product.
- Search for a product that doesn't exist.
- Add several products to the shopping cart.
- Checkout and view the final receipt.

### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I can clearly see that the labs will serve as the fundamental building blocks for our project. Specifically, I believe the the search feature is crucial. Since I'm new to JSX, I wouldn't be able to accomplish this without assistance from others.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
  
If I had more time, I would have been delighted to have add more strech

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
I like my home page alot I did a lot of styling. Something that didnt go as planed was when flitering it changes the styling of the card.
