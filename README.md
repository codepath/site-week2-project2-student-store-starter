# Project #2: Student Store

## Overview

Selling merchandise in the modern era requires digital solutions. For this project, you'll be tasked with designing and constructing an online student store for the College of Codepath. The application entails a frontend user interface for potential customers to peruse the goods, and a backend API to handle data management. The API will be built with Node and Express and the UI will be built with React.

### Application Features

#### Core Features

- [ ] Displays the following sections: header, banner, search, product grid, about, contact, and footer.
- [ ] On initial page load, display the products at the [GET /store endpoint](https://codepath-store-api.herokuapp.com/store).
- [ ] User can click on the categories (Clothing, food, etc) to filter the product grid by type.
- [ ] User can search for products.
- [ ] User can click on a product in the grid to view additional product details. Navigation is via a React Router.
- [ ] User can click to expand the shopping cart in the left navigation.
- [ ] User can click the '+' button on a product cart to increment that product in the shopping cart.
- [ ] User can click the '-' button on a product cart to increment that product in the shopping cart.
- [ ] Shopping cart displays a table of products, quantities, subtotal, tax, and total.
- [ ] User can check out, and can view receipt upon completion.

#### Stretch Features

- [ ] User can click in the top navigation bar to scroll to the relevant section.
- [ ] User sees a "not found" display when searching for a nonexistent product.
- [ ] Create an endpoint for fetching all orders in the database, and an endpoint for serving an individual order based on its id.
- [ ] Build a page in the UI that displays the list of all past orders and lets the user click on any individual order to take them to a more detailed page of the transaction.
- [ ] Allow users to use an input to filter orders by the email of the person who placed the order.

### Passing Automated Tests

The following specifications were met on the Express backend and the React frontend.

### React UI

**App.jsx**

  - [ ] The core App component that contains the routes for the app and does the initial data fetching
  - [ ] Renders a `BrowserRouter` component that contains a `Routes` component with the following routes:
    - [ ] `/` - Should render the `Home.jsx` component
    - [ ] `/products/:productId` - should render the `ProductDetail` component
    - [ ] `*` - anything else should render the `NotFound` component
  - [ ] Renders the `Navbar` component on every route
  - [ ] Renders the `Sidebar` component on every route
  - [ ] Should create **at least** the following state variables:
    - [ ] `products` - an array of product objects that is initially empty.
    - [ ] `isFetching` - a boolean value representing whether or not the App is currently fetching the `products` from the API.
    - [ ] `error` - a variable used to display a message when something goes wrong with the API requests.
    - [ ] `isOpen` - a boolean value representing whether or not the `Sidebar.jsx` is in the open or closed state.
    - [ ] `shoppingCart` - should store state for the active user's shopping cart (items they want to purchase and the quantity of each item).
      - [ ] Use whatever data type works best here, but make sure the format the `shoppingCart` as an array before passing it to other components.
      - [ ] When passed down to other components as a prop, it should formatted as an array of objects.
      - [ ] Each object in the array should have two fields:
        - [ ] The `itemId` field should store the `id` of the item being purchased.
        - [ ] The `quantity` field should store a number representing how many of that item the user is purchasing.
    - [ ] `checkoutForm` - the user's information that will be sent to the API when they checkout.
  - [ ] Leverage the `useEffect` hook to ensure that when the `App.jsx` component is mounted to the screen...
    - [ ] It should make a `GET` request to the API's `/store` endpoint with the `axios.get` method.
    - [ ] When the request completes successfully, it should store the `products` returned by the response in state.
    - [ ] If the request does not complete successfully, or there are no `products` found in the response,
            it should create an error message and store it in the `error` state variable.
  - [ ] The `App.jsx` component should define handler functions to be passed as props to the `Home` and `ProductDetail` components.
    - [ ] Define as many as are needed.
    - [ ] At minimum, **create these five handlers**:
      - [ ] The **`handleOnToggle`** function. When called...
        - [ ] It should toggle the open/closed state of the `Sidebar`.
      - [ ] The **`handleAddItemToCart`** function. When called...
        - [ ] It should accept a single argument - `productId`
        - [ ] It should add that product to the `shoppingCart` if it doesn't exist, and set its quantity to `1`.
        - [ ] If it does exist, it should increase the quantity by `1`.
        - [ ] It should add the price of the product to the total price of the `shoppingCart`.
      - [ ] The **`handleRemoveItemFromCart`** function. When called...
        - [ ] It should accept a single argument - `productId`
        - [ ] It should decrease the quantity of the item in the `shoppingCart` by `1`, but only if it already exists.
        - [ ] If it doesn't exist, the function should do nothing.
        - [ ] If the new quantity is `0`, it should remove the item from the `shoppingCart`
      - [ ] The **`handleOnCheckoutFormChange`** function. When called...
        - [ ] It should receive two arguments:
          - [ ] `name` - the `name` attribute of the input being updated
          - [ ] `value` - the new value to set for that input
        - [ ] It should update the `checkoutForm` object with the new value from the correct input(s)
      - [ ] The **`handleOnSubmitCheckoutForm`** function. When called...
        - [ ] It should submit the user's order to the API
        - [ ] To submit the user's order, it should leverage the `axios.post` method to send a `POST` request to the `/store` endpoint.
        - [ ] The body of that `POST` request should be an object with two fields:
          - [ ] The `user` field:
            - [ ] Should be an object containing `name` and `email` properties
            - [ ] Each property should be set to the correct value found in the `checkoutForm`
          - [ ] The `shoppingCart` field:
            - [ ] Should contain the user's order formatted as an array of objects.
            - [ ] Each object in the array should have two fields:
              - [ ] The `itemId` field should store the `id` of the item being purchased.
              - [ ] The `quantity` field should store a number representing how many of that item the user is purchasing.
            - [ ] Don't include the `total` price here, since we'll be calculating that on the backend. Remember to never trust the client!

          <!-- - [ ] The `item` field should store an object of the item being purchased -->
          - [ ] The `itemId` field should store the `id` of the item being purchased
          - [ ] The `quantity` field should store a number representing how many of that item the user is purchasing.
      - [ ] The `user` field should contain the name and email of the person placing the order.
      - [ ] When either the `shoppingCart` or `user` fields are missing, it should throw a `400` error.
      - [ ] If there are duplicate items in the `shoppingCart`, it should throw a `400` error.
      - [ ] If either the `quantity` or `itemId` field is missing for any of the items in the `shoppingCart`, a `400` error should be thrown.
      - [ ] When both are there, it should calculate the total cost of all the items (including quantities), add a `8.75%` tax to the total, and create a new purchase object containing 6 required fields and 1 optional field:
        - **required**:
          - [ ] `id` - the new `id` of the purchase should be equal to one more than the current number of existing purchases
          - [ ] `name` - the name of the user making the purchase

          - [ ] `order` - the `shoppingCart` value sent in the `POST` request
          - [ ] `total` - the calculated total of the order
          - [ ] `createdAt` - a string representation of the date and time when the order was placed
        - **optional**:
          - [ ] `receipt` - text describing the order (what might go on a receipt)
      - [ ] It should then send a JSON response back to the client with the new purchase like so: `{ "purchase": purchase }`. The response should have a `201` status code for a resource created action.
